        <h1>Samoan Pancakes Recipe</h1>
        <p>My brothers and I used to eat this when we were younger. They're a lot like <br>
            doughnuts but with the added fun of topping them with your favorite <br> 
            toppings.After a while of not having these, I started making them on my <br>
            own for my family, and I enjoy them as much today as I did back then!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 ⅓ cups white sugar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>2 very ripe bananas, mashed</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
                <li>6 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the flour, sugar, and baking powder in a bowl until <br>thoroughly mixed, and stir in the bananas, vanilla extract, and water <br>to make a smooth, sticky dough.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 <br>degrees C). The oil should be deep enough to completely cover the <br>panikekes while frying, or at last 3 inches deep.</li>
                <li>Scoop up a scant 1/4 cup of batter with a large spoon, and use <br>another spoon to push it off into the oil. Fry in small batches of 4 or <br>5 until they float to the top and turn golden brown, about 3 minutes<br>, then flip them to fry the other side. Remove from the fryer and let <br>drain on paper towels.</li>
            </ol>
